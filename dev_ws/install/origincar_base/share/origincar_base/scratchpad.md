# scratchpad.md: Dynamic Task Tracking and Planning Board

## Background and Motivation
- (To be filled by Planner based on initial user requirements for the new project)
+ The user wants to understand why their 30GB SD card on a remote Linux development board only shows about 14GB of usable space.
+ The primary goal is to non-destructively expand the main Linux partition to utilize the full capacity of the SD card.
+ Crucially, before attempting any partition modifications, a complete backup of the Linux board's content must be made to the user's Windows computer to prevent data loss.

## Key Challenges and Analysis
- (To be filled by Planner as the project requirements are understood)
+ **Disk Space Investigation**: 
+   - Determining the exact partition layout and filesystem types on the SD card.
+   - Identifying the reason for the discrepancy (e.g., unallocated space, hidden partitions, filesystem limitations).
+ **Backup to Windows PC**: 
+   - Choosing a reliable method for a full system backup from a remote Linux board (via SSH) to a Windows machine.
+   - Options include creating a disk image (e.g., using `dd` and transferring over SSH) or a file-based backup (e.g., `rsync` or `tar` and then transferring).
+   - Ensuring data integrity during transfer.
+   - User's technical comfort with different backup methods and Windows-side setup (e.g., SSH server on Windows for `dd` or `rsync`).
+ **Non-Destructive Partition Resizing**: 
+   - This operation carries inherent risks if not performed correctly.
+   - Requires the filesystem to support online or offline resizing (e.g., `ext4` is generally good).
+   - Depends on having unallocated space contiguous to the target partition.
+   - Identifying and using the correct Linux tools (e.g., `fdisk`, `growpart`, `resize2fs`).
+ **Disk Analysis Findings (from user-provided logs)**:
+   - The SD card `/dev/mmcblk2` is indeed ~30GB (29.74 GiB).
+   - The primary Linux partition `/dev/mmcblk2p2` (ext4, labeled `rootfs`, likely mounted as `/`) is currently ~14GB.
+   - There is approximately 15.4 GiB of unallocated space at the end of the SD card, after `/dev/mmcblk2p2`.
+   - The discrepancy between `/dev/root` on `/` (from `df -h`) and `/dev/mmcblk2p2` on `/media/sdcard2` (from `lsblk -f`) is noted, but `/dev/mmcblk2p2` is confirmed as the target partition for expansion.

## High-Level Task Breakdown
1.  **Planner**: Initial Project Setup
    1.1. Initialize core project documents (`projectrules.md`, `scratchpad.md`, `detail.md`).
+ 2.  **Planner & Executor**: Investigate Disk and Partition Layout
+     2.1. **Executor**: Connect to the Linux board and gather detailed disk information (using `df -h`, `lsblk -f`, `sudo fdisk -l <sd_card_device>`).
+     2.2. **Planner**: Analyze the collected data to understand the current partitioning and identify reasons for the ~14GB limit.
+ 3.  **Planner & User**: Plan and Confirm Backup Strategy
+     3.1. **Planner**: Propose backup methods (e.g., disk image via `dd`+SSH, file-based via `tar`+`scp`/`rsync`) with pros/cons and requirements for the Windows side.
+     3.2. **User**: Confirm preferred backup method and any necessary setup on their Windows PC.
+ 4.  **Executor**: Perform Full Backup to Windows PC
+     4.1. Execute the chosen backup procedure. This will involve Linux commands and potentially user actions on the Windows side.
+ 5.  **Planner & Executor**: Plan and Execute Partition Resizing (Post-Successful Backup)
+     5.1. **Planner**: Based on disk info and successful backup, detail the steps for non-destructive resizing.
+     5.2. **Executor**: Carefully execute partition resizing commands.
+     5.3. **Executor**: Verify the partition has been expanded and the system is stable.

## Project Status Board
*   [x] Planner: 1.1. Initialize core project documents (`projectrules.md`, `scratchpad.md`, `detail.md`)
*   [x] Planner & Executor: 2.1. Executor: Gather disk information (User provided logs).
*   [x] Planner & Executor: 2.2. Planner: Analyze disk information.
*   [x] Planner & User: 3.1. Planner: Propose backup methods.
*   [x] Planner & User: 3.2. User: Confirm backup method (Selected full disk image via dd/gzip over SSH; user has MobaXterm and sufficient space).
*   [x] Executor: 4.1. Perform full backup (User reports backup command completed and verified as normal).
*   [x] Planner & Executor: 5.1. Planner: Detail resizing steps (Detailed steps for using growpart or fdisk, reboot, and resize2fs provided to user).
*   [x] Executor: 5.2. Executor: Carefully execute partition resizing commands (growpart, reboot, lsblk verification, resize2fs all completed successfully by user).
*   [ ] Planner & Executor: 5.3. Executor: Verify resizing (Awaiting final df -h output from user).

## Executor Feedback or Help Request
- (Executor will log issues, questions, or status updates here)
- 正在等待用户提供在Linux开发板上执行 `df -h`, `lsblk -f`, 和 `sudo fdisk -l` 命令的输出，以便进行磁盘使用情况分析 (Task 2.1, 2.2)。
+ - 用户已成功执行growpart, reboot, lsblk验证, resize2fs。分区和文件系统均已扩展。等待用户提供最终的 df -h 输出以完成验证 (Task 5.2 complete, Task 5.3 pending user action)。
