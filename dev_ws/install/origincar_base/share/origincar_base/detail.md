# detail.md: AI Executor's Work Log and Short-Term Memory

## Core Purpose:
- To serve as the AI Executor's "work log" and "short-term memory enhancer," detailing specific operational steps, decision rationales, key data points, encountered problems, and their solutions.
- To ensure that the AI can quickly and accurately recall previous specific operations and choices after prolonged task interruptions, context refreshes, or restarts, avoiding redundant work and errors due to forgotten details.
- This file is dynamic and frequently updated by the Executor during operations.

## Mandatory Recording and Consultation Steps:

### Recording Occasions and Content Guide (WRITE to detail.md):
- **Timestamp and Task Identifier**: Strongly recommended (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS [Task-ID]):
- **Decision and Configuration Application**:
  - Content: Applied configs, chosen algorithms/libraries, filenames/paths, key commands, and output.
  - Reason (if not obvious): Brief explanation for choices.
  - Suggested Format: `CONFIG: <parameter_name>=<value> (Reason: <brief_reason_if_not_obvious>)`
  - Example: `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS [Task-X.Y.Z]: CONFIG: learning_rate=0.001 (Reason: Initial test with 0.01 resulted in instability)`
- **User Preference Confirmation and Application**:
  - Content: Record user preference and how it was adopted.
  - Example: `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS [Task-X.Y.Z]: USER_PREF_APPLIED: User requested function names in snake_case. Applying this to new function create_user_profile.`
  - `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS [Task-2.0 (Disk Investigation)]: USER_RULE_APPLIED: User explicitly stated: "只要是不删除或者修改文件的命令都不执行。只执行'只读'的任务。" (Only execute read-only tasks, no commands that delete or modify files). This rule will be strictly followed for all subsequent operations.`
  - `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS [Task-2.2 (Disk Analysis)]: ANALYSIS_COMPLETE: Based on user logs: /dev/mmcblk2 is ~30GB, /dev/mmcblk2p2 (rootfs, ext4) is ~14GB. Approx 15.4GB unallocated space after /dev/mmcblk2p2. This confirms the possibility of partition expansion.`
  - `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS [Task-3.1 (Plan Backup)]: PROPOSAL: Proposed two backup methods to user for backing up Linux dev board to Windows PC before partition resizing: 1. Full disk image via dd+gzip+plink (recommended for full restore). 2. File-based backup via tar+scp. Awaiting user preference, confirmation of Windows SSH client (e.g., PuTTY), and disk space availability.`
  - `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS [Task-3.2 (Confirm Backup Method)]: USER_CONFIRMATION: User selected backup method 1 (Full disk image via dd/gzip over SSH). Confirmed availability of MobaXterm on Windows and sufficient disk space. Awaiting Linux board username, IP, and Windows backup path to construct the command.`
  - `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS [Task-4.1 (Perform Backup - Command Provided)]: COMMAND_ISSUED: Provided user with the following command to run in MobaXterm local terminal for full disk image backup: ssh root@192.168.1.10 "sudo dd if=/dev/mmcblk2 bs=4M status=progress | gzip -c" > /drives/q/SynologyDrive/文档/智能车/2025-06-02/sdcard_backup.img.gz. Awaiting user execution and confirmation of backup completion.`
  - `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS [Task-4.1 (Perform Backup - Verification Pending)]: USER_REPORTED_COMPLETION: User reported that the backup command completed. Now guiding user on how to verify the backup (checking command exit status and backup file size).`
  - `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS [Task-4.1 (Perform Backup - COMPLETED)]: USER_CONFIRMED_NORMAL: User assessed the backup as normal. Backup task is considered complete.`
  - `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS [Task-5.1 (Plan Partition Resizing - Details Provided)]: PLAN_ISSUED: Detailed steps for resizing /dev/mmcblk2p2 provided to user. Recommended method: 'sudo growpart /dev/mmcblk2 2', then reboot, then 'sudo resize2fs /dev/mmcblk2p2'. Alternative fdisk method also detailed. Emphasized caution and reliance on backup. Awaiting user to perform these steps on the Linux dev board.`
  - `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS [Task-5.2 (Execute Resizing - Prerequisite Check)]: USER_EXECUTED: User ran 'sudo apt update'. Output showed GPG errors for ROS and Horizon RDK repos, but Ubuntu main repos updated. User then ran 'sudo apt install -y cloud-guest-utils', which confirmed 'cloud-guest-utils is already the newest version'. growpart tool is available and ready for use.`
  - `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS [Task-5.2 (Execute Resizing - growpart executed)]: USER_EXECUTED: User ran 'sudo growpart /dev/mmcblk2 2'. COMMAND_SUCCESSFUL. Output: 'CHANGED: partition=2 start=532480 old: size=29417472 end=29949952 new: size=61801439 end=62333919'. Partition table successfully modified. Next step: reboot.`
  - `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS [Task-5.2 (Execute Resizing - rebooted)]: USER_ACTION: User confirmed successful reboot of the Linux dev board. Next step: verify new partition size recognized by kernel.`
  - `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS [Task-5.2 (Execute Resizing - Kernel Verified Partition Size)]: USER_EXECUTED: User ran 'lsblk /dev/mmcblk2'. COMMAND_SUCCESSFUL. Output ('NAME MAJ:MIN RM SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT\nmmcblk2 179:0 0 29.7G 0 disk \n├─mmcblk2p1 179:1 0 256M 0 part /boot/config\n└─mmcblk2p2 179:2 0 29.5G 0 part /media/sdcard2') confirms /dev/mmcblk2p2 is now 29.5G. Kernel has recognized the new partition size. Next step: resize2fs.`
  - `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS [Task-5.2 (Execute Resizing - resize2fs executed)]: USER_EXECUTED: User ran 'sudo resize2fs /dev/mmcblk2p2'. COMMAND_SUCCESSFUL. Output: 'resize2fs 1.45.5 (07-Jan-2020)\nFilesystem at /dev/mmcblk2p2 is mounted on /media/sdcard2; on-line resizing required\nold_desc_blocks = 1, new_desc_blocks = 2\nThe filesystem on /dev/mmcblk2p2 is now 7725179 (4k) blocks long.'. Filesystem successfully resized. Task 5.2 is now complete. Next step: Final verification with df -h (Task 5.3).`
- **Attempts, Explorations, and Results (Including Failures)**:
  - Content: Attempted commands, code, API calls, params, outputs, errors, and results.
  - Suggested Format: `ATTEMPT: <action_description>; PARAMS: <params_used>; RESULT: <outcome_or_error_message>; ANALYSIS: <brief_analysis_or_next_step>`
  - Example: `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS [Task-X.Y.Z]: ATTEMPT: Call /api/v1/data with param 'type=all'; PARAMS: type=all; RESULT: Error 400 - Invalid type. Available types: 'A', 'B'; ANALYSIS: Will try 'type=A'.`
- **Important Discoveries and Observations**:
  - Content: Unexpected behaviors, data characteristics, system responses.
  - Example: `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS [Task-X.Y.Z]: OBSERVATION: Dataset_X.csv contains unexpected NULL values in 'critical_column'. Will need to add pre-processing step.`
- **File Operations**:
  - Content: Creation, modification, deletion of important files, summary of changes.
  - Example: `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS [Task-X.Y.Z]: FILE_MOD: Modified /config/app_settings.json - Changed 'timeout' from 30 to 60.`
- **Task Node Summary and Status**:
  - Content: At key nodes or before sub-task completion, summarize steps and status.
  - Example: `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS [Task-X.Y.Z_COMPLETED]: Feature X implementation complete. Unit tests passing. Key configs (learning_rate, batch_size) recorded above.`

### Consultation Occasions (READ from detail.md):
- Before Task Start
- When in Doubt/At Choice Points
- Avoid Repetitive Questioning/Operations
- After Session Resumption

## Style and Format:
- Accuracy, Conciseness, Consistency, Traceability, AI Readability.
